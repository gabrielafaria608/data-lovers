              Studio Ghibli, Inc., is a Japanese animation film studio
              headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. They were founded by Isao
              Takahata, Hayao Miyazaki, Toshio Suzuki, and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. The
              company began operations in June 1985 as a subsidiary of Tokuma
              Shoten Co., Ltd. for the purpose of producing animated films
              directed by Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki.

              Several anime features created by Ghibli have won the Animage
              Anime Grand Prix Award including Castle in the Sky in 1986, My
              Neighbor Totoro in 1988, and Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989. In
              2002, Spirited Away won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, the
              first anime film to win an Academy Award.

            <h3>Name</h3>
            <p>
              The name "Ghibli" is derived from the nickname the Italians used
              for their Saharan scouting planes (Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli) in the
              Second World War (and later for the AMX International AMX and
              Maserati Ghibli), which is derived from the Libyan word for hot
              wind blowing through the Sahara Desert (also known as sirocco).
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the Italian word is pronounced with a hard /ɡ/, the
              Japanese pronunciation of the studio's name is [dʑíbɯɺi], as in
              with a "soft g". The theory behind the name was that the studio
              was blowing a new wind into the Japanese anime industry. Prior to
              their independence from Tokuma Shoten in 2005, the name "Ghibli"
              had to be purchased from Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki
              were initially reluctant to buy, with Miyazaki proposing the
              studio go by a new name, "Sirocco". They ended up relenting as the
              name "Ghibli" carried far too much goodwill.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio is headed by Hayao Miyazaki
              along with Isao Takahata, as well as the studio's executive
              managing director and producer Toshio Suzuki. Its origins date
              back to 1984, with the film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind,
              which was popularized as a serialized manga in a publication of
              Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine after the original screenplay was
              rejected. Suzuki, who worked as a tabloid reporter before working
              at Animage, was the lynchpin that helped convince Miyazaki to
              pursue his manga work for Nausicaä and eventually create its film
              adaptation. The film was eventually produced by Topcraft, which
              went bankrupt on June 15, 1985, shortly after the film was
              released. Toru Hara, president of Topcraft, then sold the company
              to Toshio Suzuki and Takahata, renaming it to "Studio Ghibli".
              Hara would be retained as producer for a handful of the studio's
              early films.
            </p>
            <p>
              The formal establishment of the studio signaled a sea change for
              Miyazaki, "We can no longer overcome inferior working conditions
              by staff spirit alone. Since we have had some financial success,
              we have to take the risk and reinvest what we have accumulated. We
              need to hire new staff, train and nurture them, and we also need
              to improve work conditions for our experienced staff... We want to
              create an attractive workplace and maintain it."
            </p>
            <p>
              To prevent creative stagnation, Miyazaki help a belief that, "To
              keep Ghibli going, we must create a proper corporate structure. We
              need to stop assembling staff to make a film only to dismiss them
              once the project is completed. If we don't change this policy, we
              will have to quit being Ghibli. For us, it is too exhausting, at
              our age and with our limited physical abilities, to keep
              recreating a new workplace in Japan. This is why we have to
              leverage the foundation that we have built and improve Ghibli."
            </p>
            <p>
              Much of Ghibli's works are distributed in Japan by the noted film
              distributor Toho. While some Ghibli films received distribution
              outside Japan, such as by Streamline Pictures, it was often
              without a wide theatrical release.
